#Action Plan

    1: further develop look of site in basic HTML
        1: Splash page for user login/creation
        2: Show all the notes someone has (using cards?)
        4: Note creation page
        5: class creation
        6: special teacher stuff

    2: Develop out our data plan
     {sql view}
        1. User table
        2. Teacher table -probably dont need, unless we want not all users to make a class
            Teacher > classes 
        3. Note table
        4. Class table (One to many)
            Teacher > students


    3: We can probably just make a working prototype with justs notes and users
        1: have react website that can display

    4: User authentication 
        Maybe simple email + google?
